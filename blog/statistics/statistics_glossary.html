          In our daily life, we say a lot of things that we're not very sure about, and sometimes, no idea at all. But we all love to have opinions, and sometimes, making sure everyone knows it. <i>I study better at night.</i> Or, worse, <i>I study better after a glass of sweet-buttermilk (guilty pleasure)</i>. And to make the case stronger, we make the opinion sound robuts, by adding to it words like <i>At an average,</i> I study better at night. Or, <i>the more sweet-buttermilk I have after lunch, more the</i> amount of time I'm able to stay in the state(REM State TBH).

        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Statistics</b>: <a class="custom_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics" target="_blank">Statistics</a> is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data
          <br>
          <b>Observation</b>: (<i>interchangably used value</i>) An <a class="custom_link" href="https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6132" target="_blank">observation</a> is the value, at a particular period, of a particular variable
          <br>
          <b>Descriptive Statistics</b>: Method used to summarize or describe our observation <br>
          <b>Inferential Statistics</b>: Using those observations for making estimates or predictions, i.e. <i>inferences</i> about a situation that has not yet been investigated<br>
          <b>Population</b>:  All the case or situations, that the statisticians want their inferences 
            <br>            
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_00.JPG" class="center" style="width:80%">
            <br>
          <b>Sample</b>: A relatively small selection, from within the population
            <br>            
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_000.JPG" class="center" style="width:80%">
          <b>Random</b>: Each member of the population having equal chance of getting selected for a sample
            <br>
          <b>Stratified Random Sample</b>: Chosing the appropriate numbers, randomly from within each identified groups <i>i.e. strata</i>, in the population
            <br>
        </p>


        <p id="sample"></p>
        <h2>Describing A Sample</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Variable</b>: Any attribute or characterstic, that helps us to distinguish between one individual & others
            <br>
          <b>Category</b>: <a class="custom_link" href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=define+category" target="_blank">Category</a> is a class or division of people or things regarded as having particular shared characteristics
            <br>
          <b>Category Variables</b>: Any varibale, that involves putting individuals into categories
          <br>
          <b>Quantitative variables</b>: Quantitative variables carries data that is measure of values or counts and are expressed as numbers, e.g. Continous & Discrete variables
            <br>
          <b>Qualitative variables</b>: Qualitative variables carries data that is measure of 'types' and may be represented by a name, symbol, or a number code, e.g. Nominal & Ordinal variables
            <br>
          <b>Nominal Variables</b>: <i>Nominalis</i> is latin for name, thus, nominal variables represents differnt names a varibale may take
            <br>
          <b>Ordinal Variable</b>: An Ordinal variable is the one which helps us to disctinctly arrange sample members into in an orderly fashion, e.g. bigger-smaller, or faster-slower, or Grade-A - Grade-F, etc.
            <br>
          <b>Continous Variable</b>: A vriable that represents a value, that is <i>measurable</i> in some way, e.g. Height, Weight, volume, etc.
            <br>
          <b>Discrete Variable</b>: A variable that represents a value, that is <i>countable</i>, one in which the possible values are clearly separated, e.g. 1 Train, 2 Trucks, 3 Apples, 4 Niqqah, 5 Occeans, etc.
            <br>
          <b>Type Conversion</b>: Quantitative data can be converted into Qualitative data, i.e. converting marks to grades, however, this leads to <i>Information Loss</i>, as converted data can't be brought back to its precise past value
            <br>
        </p>

        <p id="summary"></p>
        <h2>Data Summary</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Table</b>: A <a class="custom_link" href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=definition+of+table" target="_blank">table</a> is a set of facts or figures, systematically displayed in columns
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_01.JPG" class="center" style="width: 40%">
            <br>

          <b>Frequency Table</b>: Representation of data in the form of showing frequency, for each category
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_03.JPG" class="center" style="width: 40%">
            <br>

          <b>Proportion</b>: The comparative measurements or size of different parts of a whole is <a class="custom_link" href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=define+proportion" target="_blank">Proportion</a> 
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_02.JPG" class="center" style="width: 40%">
            <br>

          <b>Block Diagram</b>: The proportion table can be graphically visualized using a graph representing categories and proportion in X & Y axis, respectively
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_04.JPG" class="center" style="width:70%">
            <br>

          <b>Pie Chart</b>: A non-linear form to represent the same information is Pie Chart<br>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_05.JPG" class="center" style="width: 30%">
            <br>

          <b>Distribution</b>: Lets considere few observations. Below given is the observation of number of student present in a class<br>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_06.JPG" class="center" style="width: 70%">
            <br>

            Data in this format is not easy to digest and defintely the best we can present in. A sinple enhancement to this would be, to arrange them in an orderly manner, i.e. Increasing or Decreasing order. Now, each of the column is sorted<br>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_07.JPG" class="center" style="width: 70%">
            <br>

            What we created above is called sa Distribution or Array, i.e. an orderly arranged quantitative variable.
            <br>

          <b>Range</b>: The differnce between the maximum and minimum value in a distribution is called the distribution's range, e.g. in the above example, the range of the distribution is 35-45, i.e. 10. <br>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_08.JPG" class="center" style="width: 80%">
            <br>

          <b>Median</b>: (<i>latin for middle</i>)For a distribution, lets say 21, 25, 45, 59 & 60, the value located at the middle is its median. Thus, for the given distribution, the median value is 45 <br>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_09.JPG" class="center" style="width: 80%">
            <br>

            And in case of even number of observations in a distribution, the midpoint from the values which divide the distribution in equal left & right side, would be the median value. <br><i>Computer programming languages may employ (number of observations+1)/2 formula to find median of even count distribution</i> <br>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_10.JPG" class="center" style="width: 80%">
            <br>

          <b>Arithmetic Mean</b>: Although Median is a good representative value of a distribution, but far more quoted one is Average. Although, almost every time someone mentions Average, they are talking about Arithmetic Mean, not the <a class="custom_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean#Types_of_means" target="_blank">other kind of means</a> <br>
            Arithmetic Mean is, addition of all the values in a distribution, and dividing the sum with the number of observations<br>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_11.JPG" class="center" style="width: 80%">
            <br>

          <b>Dot Diagram</b>: Although the distribution diagram shown above was better to digest as compared to its predecessor form, it can still be further optimized by using graphical illustraion instead of directly crunching numbers. <br>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_12_00.JPG" class="center">
            <br>
            One of those illustration could be Dot Diragram, i.e. pictorial frequency distribution table <br>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_12_01.JPG" class="center">
            <br>

          <b>Mode</b>: In a distribution, the value with greatest frequency is called as Mode of the distribution<br>
          In the above given distribution, it can be said that 37 is the mode value of the distribution <br>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_12_02.JPG" class="center">
            <br>
          <b>Histogram</b>: Another way of representing frequency distribution, specially in situation where unique observations are too large, is to group the observations in buckets, <i>i.e. via type conversion</i> of quantitative data into buckets of groups, and then plot its block diagram <br>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_13.JPG" class="center"> 
          <br>

          <b>Central Tendency</b>: It is crucial to have some ways to quanitfy the distribution, and 2 of them are <i> central tendency and variability</i><br>
          Central Tendency of the distribution is, the distribution's tendency to pile up, arround a particular value, instead of spreading out evenly acorss a range, e.g. Mean, Median & Mode <br>
          
          <b>Measure of Disperssion</b>: Graphical representation such as Dot-Diagram can be very well used to get the picture of distribution's dispression <br>

          <b>Quartiles</b>: Quartiles are 4 division of the distribution, in equal proportions, i.e. 25% for each quartile<br>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_14_00.JPG" class="center"> 
          <br>

          <b>Inter Quartile Range</b>: IQR is the distance between Q1 and Q3 <br>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_14_00.JPG" class="center"> 
            <br>

          <b>Standard Deviation</b>: Standard Deviation os a distribution is a way of indicating, a kind of average amount, by which all the values deviate from the mean<br>
              - Zero disperssion: Same values being repeated throughout the distribution<br>
              - Which means all value == mean of the distribution<br>
              - Leading to Standard Deviation = 0<br>
            
            
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_15.JPG" class="center" width="60%"> 
            <br>
          
            Since, the Deviation is a ditance calculation between an observation and the mean of the distribution it bleongs to, it can be sometimes negative in nature. This would affect the arithmetic mean. <br><br>
            - To resolve the problem, we can take square of each deviations, and totally get rid of negative value
            <br> 
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_16.JPG" class="center" style="width: 85%"> 
            <br>

          <b>Variance</b>: And the arithmetic mean of the Square Deviation is called Variance<br>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_17.JPG" class="center" style="width: 85%"> 
            <br>
            - Although Variance has a lot of merit on it own, it is still confusing for interpretation. As we took the square of deviations, to get rid of negative distances, the unit of the deviations, i.e. <i>number of cookies sold</i>, becomes <i>number of cookies sold squared</i> <br>

            - To get rid of this uncomfortable cookie monster, we can apply square root to the values, and convert <i>number of cookies sold squared</i> back to <i>number of cookies sold</i> <br>

            - Thus, if the variance of cookies sold was 270.4 <i>sold squared</i>, after square root it will become 16.443 <i>sold</i>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_18.JPG" class="center"> 
            <br>

            And, as you noticed, the very same square root of Variance, is also known as <b>Standard Deviation</b>
        </p>
        
        <p id="distribution"></p>
        <h2>Shape of Distribution</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Normal Distribution</b>: The distribution shown below is very close approximation of a Normal/Gaussian Distribution. A normla distribution has following traits:
          - symmetric bell shape, i.e. red blanket like curve over the distribution
          - mean and median are equal; both located at the center of the distribution
            <br>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_19_00.JPG" class="center" style="width: 95%"> 
            A true normal ditribution looks like this
            <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investopedia.com%2Fthmb%2FU-NYuXv6My7TA8CboH60vmGVX7k%3D%2F6250x3959%2Ffilters%3Ano_upscale()%3Amax_bytes(150000)%3Astrip_icc()%2Fdotdash_Final_The_Normal_Distribution_Table_Explained_Jan_2020-03-a2be281ebc644022bc14327364532aed.jpg&f=1&nofb=1" class="center" style="width: 95%"> 
            
            <br>
          <b>Skew</b>: Remebering whether the curve is Right-SKewed or Left SKewed, other wise Postively-Skewed or Negatively-Skewed has always been confusing for me. <br>
          One trick out of it I discovered was, Queue is a french word for tail. And S(Queue) also looks like tail. So, <br>
          - If the tail is moving in negative direction of X-Axis, it's a <i>Negatively-Skewed</i> distribution <br>
          - If the tail is moving in positive direction of X-Axis, it's a <i>Positively-Skewed</i> distribution <br>
          <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_19_01.JPG" class="center" style="width: 100%"> 
          <br>
          If the skewness of a distribution is know, thier central tendency can also be estimated <br>
          - Mean is towards the direction of the slope <br>
          - Mode is towards opoosite direction of the slope <br>
          <img src="/assets/imgs/blog/stats/stats_glossary_19_02.JPG" class="center" style="width: 100%">
