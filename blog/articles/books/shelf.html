My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3791429960">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Nice book about why and how to give your utmost attention to what you are doing. Not in terms of mindfulness, but undistracted, long stretches of undivided attention to the work having positive impact to your greater goal
